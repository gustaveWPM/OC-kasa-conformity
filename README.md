# Kasa's React App

## You have ever done a web application with React?

I didn't either...  
This is my first webapp made with React.

Project made during an _OpenClassrooms_ bootcamp.  
[Learning path: _DÃ©veloppeur Web_](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/717-developpeur-web)

**"Raw React" project.**  
**No React library allowed.**

### Implemented features

- Rescue mechanisms based on the Damerau-Levenshtein distance (and on the number of consecutive characters in common between the given string and the
  expected string) to redirect to the right page or suggest a corresponding page possibility for a given URL (typed with typos or incomplete)

  - Incomplete URLs
    - Redirection

- Dynamic database re-fetching on page first-load/change + local database caching

  placeholders)

- Animated accordions

  - Possibility to have only one accordion's item opened at a time (just pass several `items` to your `<Accordion>` component)
